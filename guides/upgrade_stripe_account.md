# How to Upgrade Your Stripe Account

**Why upgrade?**
Upgrading your Stripe account (completing verification) is required to receive payouts and use all features.

**Start here:**

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Log in to Stripe**
   - Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/ and log in with your email and password.

2. **Direct Setup Link**
   - You can use this direct link to start your Stripe setup: [Stripe Setup Link](https://connect.stripe.com/d/setup/e/_TNUHLT2Z4mHpOlTUpPtJkQvMow/YWNjdF8xU1FqSXJMTjllZ0dDMkwz/2c584ef24cff63045)

3. **Check for Upgrade/Verification Banner**
   - If your account needs upgrading, you’ll see a banner at the top or a “Complete your account” button.

4. **Start the Verification Process**
   - Click the banner, “Complete your account,” or use the direct link above.

   Stripe will ask for:
      - Your legal name and business type (individual/sole proprietor is fine for most).
      - Your address and phone number.
      - Your date of birth and last 4 digits of your SSN (for US users).
      - A photo of your government-issued ID (driver’s license, passport, etc.).
      - Your bank account details (for payouts).



5. **Forward Your Domain**
   - Forward your domain to your own affiliate link so you get credit for referrals and your customers see your instructions.
   - Your affiliate link is: `https://rizzosai.com/ref=yourusername` (replace `yourusername` with your actual username).
   - You can find instructions for forwarding your domain name to your affiliate link in your back office.

> **If you are just starting this business:**
> - For "business type," choose "Individual/Sole Proprietor" (unless you have a registered company).
> - Use your real name and home address.
> - You do NOT need an LLC or corporation to get paid—Stripe is designed for individuals too.
> - If you have questions, Stripe support can help you through the process.


5. **Upload Documents**
   - Follow the prompts to upload clear photos of your ID and any other requested documents.

6. **Submit and Wait**
   - After submitting, Stripe will review your info. This usually takes a few minutes to a few hours.
   - You’ll get an email when your account is verified.

7. **Check Your Dashboard**
   - Once verified, you’ll see no more “Complete your account” warnings.
   - You can now receive payouts and use all Stripe features.

**Tips:**
- Use your real information—Stripe is required by law to verify your identity.
- If you get stuck, use Stripe’s live chat support in the dashboard.
